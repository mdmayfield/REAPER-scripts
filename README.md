## Test of GitHub Pages

This is a project site for the REAPER-scripts section of my GitHub account. GitHub seems to be the quickest and easiest way to experiment with Jekyll, the static site building tool:
- They host and serve the pages
- There's an automated Jekyll instance rendering the pages
- Nothing to download, compile, or install

## Downloads

Testing to see if this is how to offer raw files for download as in the case of my scripts in this project.
